    The world was stunned when Mahatma Gandhi, along with thousands of his hardcore followers initiated a long walk of 390 kms from Sabarmati Ashram in Ahmedabad to Dandi, a small village near Navsari which took 24 days to reach by foot. Famously known as the Dandi March or the Salt March, this literally changed the history for India.
